## Technologies Used
### Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

### Database Storage
Postgres SQL is the database we intend to use.

### Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup is categorizing number of views into groups (target variable: y) and the tag names as our independent variable (features: X). We currently plan to use random forest model. 

### Dashboard
We currently plan to use tableau to create a dashboard.
