#Engagement rate is a formula that measures the amount of interaction social content earns relative to reach or other audience figures. Think reactions (like and dislike), comments, and shares.
#Engagement rate by views (ER views). The equation: ER view =  (comment_count + like + dislike)/ views x 100. Average ER = Total ER view/ Total views
#Factored Engagement Rate (FER). Factored engagement rates add more or less weight to certain factors in the equation, by placing a higher value on comments versus likes or dislikes, weighting each comment as two versus one. 
#FER equation: Comment_count FER = (comment_count x 2 + like + dislike) / views) *100.  Average FER = Total FER / Total view
