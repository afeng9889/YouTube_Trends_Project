#Engagement rate is a formula that measures the amount of interaction social content earns relative to reach or other audience figures. Think reactions (like and dislike), comments, and shares.
#Engagement rate by views (ER views). The equation: ER view =  (comment_count + like + dislike)/ views x 100. Average ER = Total ER view/ Total views
